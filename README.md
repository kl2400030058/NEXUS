## 1. Title Page & Abstract
**Title:** Project Nexus  
**Abstract:**  
Project Nexus is an intelligent, modular platform for Google Developer Groups (GDG) designed to integrate event management, community engagement, and analytics into a unified, user-friendly system. The project aims to simplify workflows, improve efficiency, and provide a seamless interaction between users and a rich ecosystem of tech events. Its architecture emphasizes scalability, a modern user experience, and adaptability for future enhancements.

## 2. Introduction
### Problem Statement
GDG communities often rely on multiple disjointed platforms for event announcements, bookings, and member communication, leading to inefficiency, data silos, and a fragmented user experience.

### Objectives
- To provide a centralized hub for managing and discovering all GDG-related events, including workshops, hackathons, and contests.
- To ensure a secure, fast, and scalable platform built on modern web technologies.
- To foster community engagement through features like user profiles, session bookings, and AI-powered assistance.
- To deliver an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for all stakeholders.

### Scope
Project Nexus focuses on user authentication, event discovery and booking, user profile management, and an admin dashboard for analytics. It is tailored for the GDG community but can be adapted for other tech event platforms.

## 3. System Architecture
### Layers
1.  **Presentation Layer:** A responsive user interface built with Next.js (React) and styled with Tailwind CSS, featuring components from ShadCN UI.
2.  **Application Layer:** Handles business logic and user interactions within the Next.js framework. It uses Server Actions and client-side components for a dynamic experience. Genkit is used for AI-powered features.
3.  **Data Layer:** Mock data is provided via TypeScript files, simulating a database for sessions, speakers, and user profiles. Firebase is integrated for authentication.
4.  **AI Layer:** Genkit is used to power AI features, such as the Nexus AI Assistant, providing users with intelligent query responses and suggestions.

## 4. Working Algorithm / Workflow
### Step-by-Step User Journey
1.  A user lands on the homepage, which features a prominent hero section and a search bar.
2.  The user can browse all upcoming events or use the search and filter controls to find sessions by topic (e.g., "Gen AI," "Web Dev").
3.  The user can also navigate to dedicated pages for "Hackathons," "Contests," or "Workshops" via the main header.
4.  Clicking on an event card takes the user to the session detail page, which provides a long description, speaker information, and event logistics.
5.  To book a session, the user must log in. The platform supports email/password and Google social login.
6.  Once logged in, the user can book a session with a single click. Booked sessions appear on their profile page.
7.  The user can visit their profile page to update personal information, view booked sessions, and manage notification preferences.
8.  At any point, the user can interact with the "Nexus AI Assistant" chatbot for help or to ask questions about GDG events.

### Pseudocode for Session Booking
START
  INPUT session_id, user_id
  VALIDATE user_is_logged_in
  IF valid THEN
      FETCH user_profile
      CHECK if session_id is in user_profile.bookedSessions
      IF already_booked THEN
          REMOVE session_id from user_profile.bookedSessions
          RETURN "Booking cancelled"
      ELSE
          ADD session_id to user_profile.bookedSessions
          RETURN "Booking confirmed"
      ENDIF
  ELSE
      RETURN "Login required"
  ENDIF
END
